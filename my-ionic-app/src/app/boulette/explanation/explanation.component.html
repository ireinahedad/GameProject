  <h5 class="modal-subtitle">Each player chooses words without the others knowing. The team that makes its members guess the most words wins.</h5>
  <p class="modal-paragraph">The game has 3 rounds:</p>
  <p class="modal-paragraph">In the first round, the player can use any word (but only words) to make the others guess the word (except the same words or very similar).</p>
  <p class="modal-paragraph">In the second round, the player can only use gestures to make the others guess the word.</p>
  <p class="modal-paragraph">In the third round, the player can only use one word to make the others guess the word.</p>
  <h5 class="modal-time">Time is limited and depends on the number of words in the game.</h5>
